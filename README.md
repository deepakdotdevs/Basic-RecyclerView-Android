üì± RecyclerView Demo - Android

A clean and straightforward Android application designed to demonstrate the fundamental implementation of RecyclerView. This project serves as a perfect starting point for understanding how to efficiently display large datasets in an Android app.

‚ú® Features

Efficient List Display: Showcases the power of RecyclerView for displaying scrollable lists.

ViewHolder Pattern: Implements the ViewHolder pattern for smooth scrolling and performance.

Custom Adapter: A well-commented custom Adapter to bridge the data source and the UI.

Simple UI: A minimalistic UI to keep the focus on the RecyclerView's functionality.

Data Class: Uses a Kotlin data class (itemDetails) to model the list items.

üì∏ Screenshots

Here's a glimpse of the app in action. The first image shows the main screen with the populated list, and the second one highlights the smooth scrolling experience.

üöÄ Core Concepts Demonstrated

This project is a practical example of how to correctly implement a RecyclerView. The key components involved are:

RecyclerView: The main UI component in activity_main.xml that displays the list.

Adapter (adapterClass.kt): The crucial bridge between our data (List<itemDetails>) and the RecyclerView. It's responsible for creating ViewHolders and binding data to them.

ViewHolder (Inner class in adapterClass): A container that holds the view for a single list item. It caches view lookups (findViewById) for smoother scrolling.

item_layout.xml: The XML layout file that defines the appearance of a single row in the list.

The core logic resides in the adapterClass.kt file, which manages the creation and data binding of each list item.
