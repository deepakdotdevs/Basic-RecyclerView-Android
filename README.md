## 💡 How It Works

1. **RecyclerView** is initialized in the main activity.  
2. A **custom adapter** binds a list of data (like names, images, or items) to the RecyclerView.  
3. The **ViewHolder** handles each item’s layout efficiently.  
4. Smooth scrolling and performance are maintained even with a large dataset.
